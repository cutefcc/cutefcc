- 🐛 I only play with react and typescript and its related ecosystem, don't discuss vue with me
- 🦗 When it comes to state management, I absolutely love Atomic State. redux, jotai, zustand, recoil, XState are all I have used and like very much
- 🌱 I’m currently learning babylon.js、three.js、react-three-fiber、blender and other front-end graphics related knowledge
- 🍎 I'm also interested in blockchain, such as: MetaMask, Tezos, Temple, Taquito, IPFS, web3-react
