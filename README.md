- 🐛 I only play with react and typescript and its related ecosystem, don't discuss Vue with me.

- 🦗 When it comes to state management, I absolutely love Atomic State. 
  - Redux, Jotai, Zustand, Recoil, XState are all I have used and like very much.
  
- 🦐 When it comes to CSS, I've used CSS Modules, css in js (like @emotion/styled), but when I meet *tailwindcss*, I think I've found love.

- 🐔 The component library is definitely a must-have for the front end. I use verdadcio to build a private library for the company, and have developed component libraries based on Antd and Material UI. Of course, I prefer MUI by comparison.

- 🐷 I love AWS and CloundFlare and have built some of my own test apps on top of it.

- 🦊 What I am proud of: I have promoted the implementation of tailwind, jotai, immer, dva -> webpack5 + redux + tailwind, monorepo (lerna + pnpm workspace), and front-end performance monitoring systems in the company

- 🌱 I’m currently learning babylon.js、three.js、react-three-fiber、blender and other front-end graphics related knowledge.

- 🍎 I'm also interested in blockchain, such as: MetaMask, Tezos, Temple, Taquito, IPFS, web3-react.
