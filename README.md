- 🐛 I only play with `react` and `typescript` and its related ecosystem.

- 🦗 When it comes to state management, I love Atomic State absolutely. 
  - `Redux`, `Jotai`, `Zustand`, `Recoil`, `XState` are all I have used and like very much.
  
- 🦐 When talking about CSS, I've used `CSS Modules`, `css in js` (like @emotion/styled), but when I meet `tailwindcss`, I think I've found love.

- 🐔 The `component library` is definitely a must-have for the front end. I use `verdadcio` to build a private library for the company, and have developed component libraries based on Antd and `Material UI`. Of course, I prefer `MUI` by comparison.

- 🐷 I love `AWS` and `CloundFlare` and have built some of my own test apps on top of it.

- 🦊 What I am proud of: I have promoted the implementation of `tailwind`, `jotai`, `imme`r, `dva -> webpack5 + redux + tailwind`, monorepo (lerna + pnpm workspace), and front-end `performance monitoring` systems in the company

- 🌱 I’m currently learning `babylon.js`、`three.js`、`react-three-fiber`、`blender` and other front-end graphics related knowledge.

- 🍎 I'm also interested in `blockchain`、`web3`, such as: `Dapp`, `Wallet` (`MetaMask`,Temple), Tezos, Taquito, Ganache, Truffle, ethers, `IPFS`, `web3-react`. We've won a prize at `2022 Wanxiang Fall Hackathon`
- 🐶 You can contact me via email `cquliuhao@gmail.com`, and I really enjoy discussing various issues with you.
